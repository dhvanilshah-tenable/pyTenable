The list of all URLs that have been detected during the scan are available as an attachment. For each URL in the sitemap, the following information is provided:

- The first time the URL is detected - The logic used to detect the URL. This information may be found by: crawling rendering the page by a specific plugin - The parent URL requested to detect the URL - If the URL has been requested at least once, information about the response - Whether or not the URL has been queued for audit - If the URL has not been queued for audit, the reason why the URL does not need an audit - Whether or not the URL has been effectively audited - If the URL has not been effectively audited, the reason that the scanner was unable to audit the URL


Reasons for not adding a URL to the audit queue are as follows:

- not_in_domain: The domain of the URL does not match main target URL - scope_configuration: The URL does not match scope include list scan settings - directory_depth: The number of directories in the URL path exceeds the scan configuration setting - exclude_file_extension: The URL file extension matched one entry of the file extension blacklist setting - exclude_path_patterns: The URL matched one entry of the URL exclusion blacklist setting - redundant_path: The number of URLs to be audited with the same path and query string parameters has been reached - request_redirect_limit: The number of HTTP redirects allowed per scan configuration setting has been reached - queue_full: The number of URLs to audit has been reached


If a scan fails to audit a URL that has been queued for audit, reasons for the failure are as follows:

- timeout: The request timed out when trying to retrieve URL contents - filesize_exceeded: URL response exceeded file size limit defined in the scan configuration - scan_timelimit_reached: The URL couldnâ€™t be audited before the scan time limit - user_abort: The user stopped the scan before the URL could be audited",,,"The scan has discovered 11 distinct URLs, 1 of which are in the target scope.
