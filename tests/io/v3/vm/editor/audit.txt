# Description:
#
# This document consists of a list of general Red Hat Linux best practices as suggested by the IT-Grundschutz BSI-Standard 100-2.
# Tenable has made a best effort to map the settings specified in the standard to a proprietary
# .audit format that will be used by the Unix compliance module to perform the audit.
