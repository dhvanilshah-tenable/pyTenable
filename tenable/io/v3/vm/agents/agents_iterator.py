class AgentsIterator(TIOIterator):
    '''
    The agents iterator provides a scalable way to work through agent result
    sets of any size.  The iterator will walk through each page of data,
    returning one record at a time.  If it reaches the end of a page of
    records, then it will request the next page of information and then
    continue to return records from the next page (and the next, and the next)
    until the counter reaches the total number of records that the API has
    reported.

    Attributes:
        count (int): The current number of records that have been returned
        page (list):
            The current page of data being walked through.  pages will be
            cycled through as the iterator requests more information from the
            API.
        page_count (int): The number of record returned from the current page.
        total (int):
            The total number of records that exist for the current request.
